# excel-simple-inventory
A simple inventory management system for excel using office scripts

The osts files need to be placed in your onedrive office scripts directory before using the main spreadsheet, /Documents/Office Scripts and 
double check the buttons are connected, if not you may need to reconnect using the 'Automate' option on the Excel menu.

Know issues:

I have't yet put error messages on the sheet so if anything goes wrong follow the 'view logs' button when shown and check the Output at the 
bottom rightbhand corner, this will indicate what's wrong e.g. missing product number, purchase Order etc.

Reports are just below minimum at present, more may be added later

As with all office scripts the first run of each button can be slow so watch for the Run Status to change, the subsequent runs will be faster as
this is a limitaiton of Office Scripts and there is nohting I can do other than write it in VBA which is counter to why I wrote this in the first
place. 

It works in botht the desktop and web app as long as you have a 365 account.
